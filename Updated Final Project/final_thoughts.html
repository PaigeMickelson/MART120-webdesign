 <h1>-Final Thoughts-</h1>
<br/>
<h2>I really have enjoyed my time studying code in MART120!</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Making this portfolio was a great final project as I was able to go back and see how far I have come in the coding world!</h3>
<h3>While I do not plan to take anymore coding classes here at UM due to my major, I hope I will be able to use the skills I learned more in the future. </h3>
<h3>I am happy I took this class regardless becasue it gave me time to be creative and carve out time in my academics for my own thinking.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Until next time!</h2>
